The Music Student is a creature with extreme patience, needed to learn all the techniques related to ternary compass atonalisms, has the capacity to create them and a distorted taste for playing one of the most bizarre and occult musical instruments.|Creator's Note: 'Based on the idea that musical tastes are distinct and only the the most open-minded people appreciate distinct rhythms (obviously all that aren't attempts to kill the musical concept), the class was made. So, the same sound, Bach for example, can be beautiful music or terribly boring, depending upon the ear of the listener. Probably a progressive fan will like Bach, but a fan of Tati-Quebra-Barraco, without any musical sense, will think Bach is shit. So, the Music Student will be virtuous and misunderstood.'")
